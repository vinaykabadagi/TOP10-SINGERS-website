        <p class="main">You want to be sure to start an argument with passionate musicians? Ask them who belongs 
            in the top 10 best singers of all time list. Given enough time you'd come up with at least
             50 names because so much of it comes down to taste and preference.<br>
        
            Fortunately, because so many of us have voiced our opinions we can tell which 
            vocalists have the most mass appeal, which should be taken into account. But splashed 
            in here are my personal picks, and I expect to hear two types of complaints: <q> that person
             shouldn't be in there</q> and <q>where's my favorite singer in the list?</q><br>
             So here's a list of my top 10 (in no particular order) favorite singers!

                    director, producer and screenwriter.  He was one of the most popular singers in the Indian film industry and from 
                    soft numbers to peppy tracks to romantic moods, Kumar sang in different genres  but some of his rare compositions 
                    which were considered classics were lost in time.  According to Ashok Kumar, Kumar's success came because his voice 
                    hit the microphone straight at its most sensitive point. <br>

                       Rahman initially composed scores for different documentaries and jingles for advertisements and Indian television channels

                        film Roja.  Following that, he went on to score several songs for Tamil language films, including Ratnam's 
                        politically-charged Bombay, the urban Kadhalan, Thiruda Thiruda and S. Shankar's debut film Gentleman. Rahman's 
                        score for his first Hollywood film, the comedy Couples Retreat (2009), won the BMI Award for Best Score. His music 
                        for Slumdog Millionaire (2008) earned him Best Original Score and Best Original Song at the 81st Academy Awards.
